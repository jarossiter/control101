    <p>
<h2> Introductory information </h2>		
<span style="font-family:Arial">
<span style="font-size:12pt">

Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy and quick to use, and support student understanding and learning at an introductory level. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.
	<br>
	<br>
  The community toolbox project is led by Anthony Rossiter (University of Sheffield) with sponsorship from MathWorks and input from numerous international colleagues (e.g. Ruth Bars (Budapest University of Technology and Economics , Antonio Visioli (Universita di Brescia), Sebastian Dormido (UNED), Lanlan Su (University of Sheffield), Ross Drummond (University of Sheffield)). If you have suggestions or possible contributions, please contact Anthony (j.a.rossiter@sheffield.ac.uk).

<p style="font-family:Arial"><span style="font-size:12pt"> <br>
  Resources are divided into: <br>
  1. <strong>Virtual laboratories </strong> (section 3) which have simple GUI interfaces so students can select buttons and sliders to observe the behaviour of some authentic scenarios and see how different parameter choices affect behaviour. Each virtual laboratory comprises two files which run independently: i) the mlapp file which is the laboratory itself and ii) a partner livescript file which acts like a concise manual giving context, illustrative MATLAB source code and some technical background.  A typical naming convention for the paired app files is: mixingtank_and_behaviour.mlapp and mixingtank_and_behaviour_manual.mlx. If accessing the apps via the installed toolbox and thus installed apps toolbar, the manual (mlx file) will be opened simultaneously. <br>
  2. <strong>Livescript files</strong> &nbsp;(section 2) which focus more on useful MATLAB code students can use to create their own files to support detailed analysis, evaluation and design, as required for university courses and assignments.   If accessing the livescript files via the installed toolbox, typing the file name  will open a livescript with the filename ending "_mycopy" in the current working directory, so the user can easily make and save any changes.<br>
	3. <strong>Simulink files</strong> &nbsp;(section 4) which support the simulation and analysis of scenarios where there are non-linear components and/or it may be difficult to code a model using simple script files.</span></p>

  A quick list of the available resources is given below, with links to more complete summary information. For a more detailed overview and recent updates, see the website: <a href="website">https://controleducation.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/matlabresources/section-6-11-community-control-toolbox</a> <br>

  Some youtube videos <a href="videos">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs7mcKy_nInHEjth9P3m_bxd6D24IVSzz</a> give quick illustrations of the toolbox and how to use the files. <br>

<h2 id = getting> 1. Getting started </h2>
We assume that the user has downloaded the toolbox from the add-ons button within MATLAB. The toolbox is searched for using the tag 'Control 101' or 'Control101' under the add-ons button.
<br>
	<br>
  1. All the virtual labs will appear in the apps tab as illustrated here and are started simply by selecting the relevant icon. A copy of the livescript manual will also be opened in the present working directory. 
	
<br>
<span style="margin-left:10px;"><figure><a href="">

  <figcaption>Illustration of the appearance of the virtual lab 'apps'</figcaption>
</a></figure></span>
	
	<br>
	<br>
	2. To access the livescripts, either use the soft links in this file (section 2.2) or type the name in the command window (as illustrated below); this will open the relevant .mlx file in an editor window as required. 
	<br><br>
	
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> When using the installed toolbox, MATLAB will open a copy of the livescript in the present working directory so that the user can make and save edits without changing the toolbox original.

        This file takes a user through the entire process of modelling, analysing, controller design and final evaluation, for a tank level system, in the presence of multiple forms of uncertainty. Different tabs move the user along the storyline. The first tab explores open-loop behaviour and the impact of flow disturbances and blockages to hte outlet pipe. The second tab focuses on modelling in time constant form. The third tab covers manual control subject to uncertainty. The fourth tab introduces PI design and the fith tab is an opportunity to evaluate the final PI design, subject to more varied uncertainty, so including sensor delays and measurement noise.

        For tabs 1, 3 and 4, the top right figure store previous simulations so the user can observe trends and understand design principles; use refresh if  this is unhelpful. The bottom right figure forms a different role in each tab so is automatically refreshed for each simulation. Animation effects in the top figure also bring some life and visualisation to the app.
