AppName: Behaviour of an RC circuit with and without leakage 
Author: John Anthony Rossiter, University of Sheffield

Creation Date: 2026

Matlab version used: 2025a

Matlab packages used: Control Toolbox, Symbolic toolbox

App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This is a simple interface to understand the behaviour and modelling of simple RC ciruits with and without a leakage resistance in the capacitor. The user can explore, compare and contrast how behaviour changes with a small range of alternative values.  More detailed descriptions and help are in the partner livescript file rc_circuit_behaviour_control101_manual.mlx which give a concise engineering and analytical background alongside some simple MATLAB code snippets than can be used for equivalent analysis.
