Creation Date: 2024

Matlab version used: 2024a

Matlab packages used: Control Toolbox, Symbolic toolbox, Simulink

App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This folder contains a number of files which focus on topics that would come at the end of a first course in control or more advanced topics. The intention is to give users insight into some of the more practical or challenging issues that might occur and some of the relatively well accepted solutions in the community.
