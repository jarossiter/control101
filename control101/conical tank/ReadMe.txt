App description:  Several people have developed MATLAB based materials to support the teaching of “Control Systems 101” type courses; the particular focus here is on interactive and animated resources which are largely self-explanatory, that is easy to use,  and support student understanding and learning. They demonstrate authentic scenarios across a broad range of topics which motivate the importance of control to modern society, alongside some technical learning outcomes to support university curricula.

This resource provides an interactive app file (MATLAB virtual laboratory) which demonstrates core learning outcomes linked to nonlinear behaviours. Specifically the focus is on a conical tank. This has nonlinearities due to both the outflow depending on pressure difference and also, the variation in cross sectional area with depth. Users are able to observe and understand the limitations of linear models by investigations on this app. It also includes realistic effects such as:  measurement noise, input saturation, and windup. Users can also change some of the tank parameters to perform compare and contrast simulations with different assumptions. The manual and app also give guidance on the underlying scenario and how to use the simulink files directly.
